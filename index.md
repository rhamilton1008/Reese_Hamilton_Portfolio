## [2021 Masters Dashboard](https://aweirth.shinyapps.io/masters_dashboard/)
Click on the project title to explore the dashboard for yourself!<br><br>
For this project I worked with my classmate Alex Weirth to create a platform for deeper analysis of performance stats within professional golf than currently exists.<br><br>
We consolidated all of the scores and availible statisics from the 2021 Masters and created a Shiny App (R) so that users could explore the statistics from the tournament themselves.<br>
<br>
The users click on a players name on the leaderboard to bring up a couple visualizations that explore "strokes gained" statistics. The are considered some of the best statistics for evaluating performance in golf.<br><br>

These visualizations allow users to examine how player performed in different aspects of the tournament that likely led to their successes or failures in a way that looks clean and is easy to interpret.
